## Swift Basics: Apple promo 
## Created by Roots : Mohammad, Yolanda, Alexandre, Henri, Shelley
Our group was given the task to create an App reagarding the environment. Our group decided to create an app to help everyday people take small actions in the hope that small things add up to bigger things. We wanted to motivate and educated individuals on how to change their habits and based our model on positive reinforcement. We imagined that each positive action would give a certain number of points to each individual. We also thought that groups stimulate and help keep up the momentum - so we also wanted individuals to create or join goups. or even join a city group.

# Technical Talk
## Xcode and Swift
* We  used an MVC architecture, 
* we didn't have a database so we mocked one with a file - actionsDB.swif
*  Xcode Version 10.3 (10G8)
* For the list of actions we wanted to create a segmented view but didnt have the time to finish the logic.

```
segmented view and enum switch cases for view controller
